                    <p>Hello there! I'm Willy Vanderpool, an 18-year-old Computer Information Science student. My passion for programming started long before college, sparked by curiosity and a love for creating things from scratch. Over the years, I've gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Lua, and recently I've been diving deeper into modern frameworks such as React, TailwindCSS, and .NET MAUI. Outside of programming, some of my hobbies include drawing pixel art, playing videogames, and collecting Pok√©mon cards.</p>

                    <p>My name is Paul Bute, and I'm a CIS student at Ozark's Tech. I'm the current Vice President of Tech2Gether. My goals for the club this year are to boost engagement and engage students in programming challenges and competitions. As of the beginning of the Fall semester, it will be my 2nd year at Ozarks Tech. I'm mainly a Web Developer, with experience in C# ASP.NET apps, as well as JS & Vue. I enjoy learning new skills and exploring how problems can be solved in more than one way. I enjoy reading, gaming & baking in my free time. Before Ozarks Tech I was part of the workforce for 7 years. I have experience in warehouse picking, shipping & handling, management and customer service. I also spent four years in the hospitality industry, and a year as a Tower Technician doing structural modifications on cell phone towers.</p>

                    <p>Hiya! My name is Laura, and I'm the Tech2Gether secretary for the 2025-2026 school year. I'm currently working on my Associate's degree in Computer Science at Ozarks Tech. I have enjoyed all that I've learned in my time at Ozarks Tech: Python, C#, .NET MAUI, Java, and Web Development. In my free time, I love building Magic: The Gathering decks, writing/playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends, and playing/building videogames. I'll be graduating in the Spring 2026 Semester (hopefully) so look out for officer nominations in the spring to get my job! I'm so excited to help Tech2Gether continue its outreach to students by providing fun educational, networking, and programming events to members and all Ozarks Tech students alike! It's going to be a fun year.</p>
